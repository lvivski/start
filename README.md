# Start

Small server-side Dart web development framework.

It uses [Hart](https://github.com/lvivski/hart "lvivski/hart") as default template engine and can serve static files from `public` folder (by default).

``` dart
#library('app');

#import('lib/start.dart');
#import('lib/server.dart');

class App extends Server {
  App(): super() {
    get('/', (req, res) {
      res
        .render('index', {'title': 'Start'});
    });

    get('/hello/:name.:lastname?', (req, res) {
      res
        .header('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=UTF-8')
        .send('Hello, $req.param('name') $req.param('lastname')');
    });
  }
}

void main() {
  start(new App(), '127.0.0.1', 3000);
}
```
